They may include: flatulence (wind) diarrhoea bloated stomach stomach cramps and pains stomach rumbling feeling sick The severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you''ve consumed. Some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee. When to seek medical advice The symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it''s important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet. For example, the symptoms above can also be caused by: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) – a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system milk protein intolerance – an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy) If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve. Read more about diagnosing lactose intolerance. What causes lactose intolerance? The body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. People with lactose intolerance don''t produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it''s fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. Depending on the underlying reason why the body isn''t producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks. Read more about the causes of lactose intolerance. Who''s affected? In the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent. Lactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected. Is it an allergy? Lactose intolerance isn''t the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This causes symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching. If you''re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person). Treating lactose intolerance There''s no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to control the symptoms. Depending on what dairy products you''re able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. These are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose. Read more about treating lactose intolerance. Complications of lactose intolerance Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. If you''re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. Osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. Malnutrition – when the food you eat doesn''t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you''re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. If you''re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements. Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian.', '', '', '', 'There''s no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet.

Read more about the symptoms of jaundice in babies.', 'in the whites of their eyes, inside their mouth, on the soles of their feet, on the palms of their hand, be poor at sucking or feeding, be sleepy, have a high-pitched cry, be limp and floppy, have darkyellowurine– it should becolourless, have pale poo– it should be yellow or orange, ', '', '', 'You should speak to your midwife, health visitor or GP if your baby develops jaundice. They''ll be able to assess whether treatment is needed. Treatment is usually only necessary if your baby has high levels of a substance called bilirubin in their blood, so tests need to be carried out to check this. See diagnosing jaundice in babies for more information about the tests used. Most babies with jaundice don''t need treatment because the level of bilirubin in their blood is found to be low. In these cases, the condition usually gets better within 10 to 14 days and won''t cause any harm to your baby. If treatment is felt to be unnecessary, you should continue to breastfeed or bottle feed your baby regularly, waking them up for feeds if necessary. If your baby''s condition gets worse or doesn''t disappear after two weeks, contact your midwife, health visitor or GP. Prolonged newborn jaundice (lasting longer than two weeks) can occur if your baby was born prematurely or if he or she is solely breastfed. It usually improves without treatment. However, further tests may be recommended if the condition lasts this long to check for any underlying health problems. If your baby''s jaundice doesn''t improve over time or tests show high levels of bilirubin in their blood, they may be admitted to hospital and treated with phototherapy or an exchange transfusion. These treatments are recommended to reduce the risk of a rare but serious complication of jaundice called kernicterus, which can cause brain damage. See complications of jaundice in babies for more information about kernicterus.', ''),
