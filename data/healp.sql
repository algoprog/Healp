Drinking alcohol in excess or being overweight increases your likelihood of developing atrial fibrillation. You may also be at risk of developing an arrhythmia if your heart tissue is damaged because of an illness – for example, if you have had a heart attack or have heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke. Having atrial fibrillation means your risk of stroke is five times higher than for someone whose heart rhythm is normal. Certain types of arrhythmia occur in people with severe heart conditions, and can cause sudden cardiac death. This kills 100,000 people in the UK every year. Some of these deaths could be avoided if the arrhythmias were diagnosed earlier.

(238, 'Predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genes', 'Cancer is not usually inherited, but some types – mainly breast, ovarian, colorectal and prostate cancer – can be strongly influenced by genes and can run in families. We all carry certain genes that are normally protective against cancer – they correct any DNA damage that naturally occurs when cells divide. Inheriting faulty versions or "variants" of these genes significantly raises your risk of developing cancer, because the altered genes cannot repair the damaged cells, which can build up and form a tumour. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of genes that raise your cancer risk if they become altered. Having a variant BRCA gene greatly increases a woman''s chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This was the reason Angelina Jolie had preventative breast cancer surgery, followed by ovarian cancer surgery. They also increase a man''s chance of developing male breast cancer and prostate cancer.  BRCA genes are not the only cancer risk genes. Researchers recently identified more than 100 new gene variants associated with an increased risk of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. Individually, these new gene variants only slightly increase the risk of cancer, but a combination could mean a high risk overall.

(241, 'Breast cancer screening', 'Women aged 70 to 79: missed screening invitations Find out what to do if you''re aged 70 to 79 and think you may not have received a breast screening invitation. About 1 in 8 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. If it''s detected early, treatment is more successful and there''s a good chance of recovery. Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when they''re too small to see or feel. But there are some risks of breast cancer screening that you should be aware of. As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, all women aged 50 to 70 and registered with a GP are automatically invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years. In the meantime, if you''re worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or area of thickened tissue in a breast, or you notice that your breasts look or feel different from what''s normal for you, don''t wait to be offered screening – see your GP. Why is breast screening offered? Most experts agree that regular breast screening is beneficial in identifying breast cancer early. The earlier the condition is found, the better the chances of surviving it. You''re also less likely to need a mastectomy (breast removal) or chemotherapy if breast cancer is detected at an early stage. The main risk is that breast screening sometimes picks up cancers that may not have caused any symptoms or become life threatening. You may end up having unnecessary extra tests and treatment. Read about the pros and cons of breast cancer screening. When will I be offered breast screening? Breast screening is currently offered to women aged 50 to 70 in England. But currently there''s a trial to examine the effectiveness of offering some women one extra screen before the age of 50 and one after 70. You''ll first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthday, although in some areas you''ll be invited from the age of 47 as part of the trial extension of the programme. You may be eligible for breast screening before the age of 50 if you have a very high risk of developing breast cancer. For more information, read having a family history of breast cancer. If you''re over the age of 70, you''ll stop receiving screening invitations. You can still have screening after 70 if you want to, and can arrange an appointment by contacting your local screening unit or GP. Find breast screening units in your area. What happens during breast screening? Breast screening involves having an X-ray (mammogram) at a special clinic or mobile breast screening unit. This is done by a female health practitioner. Your breasts will be X-rayed one at a time. The breast is placed on the X-ray machine and gently but firmly compressed with a clear plate. Two X-rays are taken of each breast at different angles. For more information, read what happens during breast cancer screening.  Breast screening results After your breasts have been X-rayed, the mammogram will be checked for any abnormalities. The results of the mammogram will be sent to you and your GP no later than 2 weeks after your appointment. Following screening, about 1 in 25 women will be called back for further assessment. Being called back doesn''t mean you definitely have cancer. The first mammogram may have been unclear. About 1 in 4 women who are called back for further assessment are diagnosed with breast cancer.

Carotid artery Plaque blocking artery Blood clot If a narrowed carotid artery is left untreated, blood flow to the brain may be affected. This is usually because a blood clot forms and a piece breaks off and goes to the brain.

More than 5,000 carotid endarterectomy procedures were performed on the NHS between 2011 and 2012. Carotid endarterectomy can significantly reduce the risk of a stroke in people with severely narrowed carotid arteries. In people who have previously had a stroke or a TIA, their risk of having another stroke or TIA within the next three years is reduced by a third after surgery.

(709, 'Lactose intolerance', 'Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance usually develop within a few hours of consuming food or drink that contains lactose. They may include: flatulence (wind) diarrhoea bloated stomach stomach cramps and pains stomach rumbling feeling sick The severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you''ve consumed. Some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee. When to seek medical advice The symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it''s important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet. For example, the symptoms above can also be caused by: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) – a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system milk protein intolerance – an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy) If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve. Read more about diagnosing lactose intolerance. What causes lactose intolerance? The body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. People with lactose intolerance don''t produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it''s fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. Depending on the underlying reason why the body isn''t producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks. Read more about the causes of lactose intolerance. Who''s affected? In the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent. Lactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected. Is it an allergy? Lactose intolerance isn''t the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This causes symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching. If you''re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person). Treating lactose intolerance There''s no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to control the symptoms. Depending on what dairy products you''re able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. These are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose. Read more about treating lactose intolerance. Complications of lactose intolerance Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. If you''re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. Osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. Malnutrition – when the food you eat doesn''t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you''re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. If you''re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements. Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician.
